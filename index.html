  <h2>About Lord Ayyappa</h2>
  <div class="card">
    <p>Lord Ayyappa is a revered Hindu deity widely worshipped in South India, especially in Kerala. 
        He is regarded as the son of Lord Shiva and Mohini, the female incarnation of Lord Vishnu.
        Ayyappa symbolizes righteousness (Dharma), self-control, and unity beyond social divisions.
    </p>
    <p>He is also known as Dharma Shasta and Hariharasuta, reflecting the combined essence of Vishnu (Hari) and Shiva (Hara).</p>

  <h2>The True Story of Lord Ayyappa</h2>
  <div class="card">
    <p>According to Hindu tradition, Lord Vishnu assumed the form of Mohini to vanquish the demoness Mahishi, who could only be defeated by a child born of Shiva and Vishnu. From this divine union, Ayyappa was born.</p>
    <p>The infant Ayyappa was found and adopted by the Pandalam king, Rajashekhara. As he grew, Ayyappa displayed extraordinary wisdom and valor. He later fulfilled his destiny by defeating Mahishi, restoring cosmic balance, and choosing a life of renunciation. The sacred shrine at Sabarimala marks the place where Ayyappa took eternal residence.</p>
